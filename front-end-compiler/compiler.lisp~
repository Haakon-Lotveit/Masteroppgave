;;; Front end compiler for the project
;;; Currently everything here is a sketch, and nothing is final.

;;; There are four main things that have to be defined here:
;;;  - How to insert text (plain, markdown or others)
;;;  - How to insert lists (ordered, unordered)
;;;  - How to insert tables (two dimensional ones, from CSV only)
;;;  - How to insert images

;;; In addition to this, an abstraction facility must be made available to let
;;; the users create their own rules that extend on the above four things.
