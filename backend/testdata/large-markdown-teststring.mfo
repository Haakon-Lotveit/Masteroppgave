This is not a normal test string.
in fact, it has both (CURSIVE cursive) words,
some (UNDERLINE underlined) words, and last but not least,
it has (EMPHASISED bolded) words.
Furthermore it has quotes:
(QUOTE 
The problem with online citations is that it's hard to know if they are authentic or not.
- Abraham Lincoln (CITE Lincoln1984))
And monospaced text too:
(NEW-PARAGRAPH)
(CODE 
public class HelloWorld(FOOTNOTE The classic Java Hello World example) {
    public static void main\(String[] args\) {
        System.out.println\("Hello World!"\);
    }
})
(NEW-PARAGRAPH)
(HORIZONTAL-LINE)
And here are two lines!
(HORIZONTAL-LINE)
(HEADLINE :LEVEL "4" This is a level 4 header)
(HEADLINE :LEVEL "1" And here is a level 1 header!)
(HEADLINE :LEVEL "2" Note that you only need 4 chars to make it a header.)
(NEW-PARAGRAPH)
(HEADLINE :LEVEL "3" It does have links!)
(NEW-PARAGRAPH)
(URL :NAME "Links look like this!" :URL "www.example.com" :ALT-NAME "eksempelnettsted")
You can escape them by prepending '\\\\' characters on the brackets. Only one of the chars need to be escaped.
Escaping the parens has some weird bug in it.
\\\\[This is an escaped link]\(www.example.com "eksempelnettsted"\) and will not be made a URL
(NEW-PARAGRAPH)
Please note that the current in-between language treats parens as magical characters unless escaped.
So if you want to use parens \(like this!\), you have to escape them with forward-slashes \(\\\\\)
(NEW-PARAGRAPH)
(HEADLINE :LEVEL "2" Here are some list examples)
Not to be outdone, here's a list:
(UNORDERED-LIST
(LINE-ITEM This is the first item of the list.)
(LINE-ITEM This is the second item of the list, which makes you less likely to remember the contents.)
(LINE-ITEM Along with this third item. You tend to remember the beginning and ends of strings the best, you see.)
(LINE-ITEM This fourth item is the one you're most likely to remember.))
(NEW-PARAGRAPH)
And that's about all for now. I should add in some extras, such as:
(ORDERED-LIST
(LINE-ITEM citations)
(LINE-ITEM ordered lists)
(LINE-ITEM headers, of the ---- and ==== varieties)
(LINE-ITEM headers of the ### H3 ### and ## H2 ## variety.)
(LINE-ITEM citations \(an extension to the markdown language.\)))
