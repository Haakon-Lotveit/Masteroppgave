# Example document for markdown #

This is an *example* document for _markdown_.
Markdown is a pain in the ass to parse, but we still love it.
Mostly because it's easy to write.

  - This is a list
  - This is the second thing on the list

  1. This list is numbered
  3. Markdown doesn't care about order though.
  2. So feel free to just use random numbers

That's it!
